1 a true-blue delight .
0 thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
1 -lrb- shyamalan -rrb- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .

1 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity .

0 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
1 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .
0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
0 -lrb- sam 's -rrb- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .

1 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .
1 ... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun .
0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
0 other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
0 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
0 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
1 deflated ending aside , there 's much to recommend the film .
1 a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .
1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good .
1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
1 the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .
1 even though it 's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you ca n't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company 's astonishing growth .
1 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .
1 `` 13 conversations about one thing '' is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling .
1 beautifully directed and convincingly acted .
0 the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .
1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director peter jackson 's expanded vision of j.r.r. tolkien 's middle-earth .
1 daring and beautifully made .
0 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
0 but the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
1 most consumers of lo mein and general tso 's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons .
1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .
0 human nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .

1 the film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .
1 it 's a masterpeice .
1 this one is a few bits funnier than malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
1 the journey to the secret 's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough .
1 `` simone '' is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality .
0 why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?
0 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
0 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .
1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
0 never does `` lilo & stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan . ''
0 a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
0 more a gunfest than a rock concert .
0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
